# Pathalgo - Path finding algorithm visualizer

## Features:
- Finding shortest path from starting point to target
- Building/removing wall as obstacle
- Moving starting point and target
- Re-calculating shortest path as board changes
- Creating board based on initial window's size

## Algorithm:
- [x] Breath first search
- [ ] Depth first search
